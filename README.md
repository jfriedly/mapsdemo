This is a demo of integrating a Google Map with filters to display / hide sets of locations that I did for a client.  The source code is available under the MIT License.

###Copyright
The blue picture isn't mine, but I can't remember where I got it from. I don't think anyone cares though, so I'll take it down if I get a DMCA notice but I think it's fine for now.
